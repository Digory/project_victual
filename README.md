### **Project Victual**


CodeClan group project. A web app for managing daily nutrient intake.

### **Background**

The aim of the app is to allow a user to monitor their daily intake of nutrients, and compare these against the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA). Data for this is provided by several APIs run by Edamam (https://developer.edamam.com/).

The user is able to create a list of the foods they have consumed that day. The data is persisted and the user can monitor their intake over days/weeks/months.

The user can then view how the nutrients they are getting from their diet compares to the RDA of that nutrient. They are then able to spot whether they are consuming enough, for example, Vitamin C on a day-to-day basis.

### **Features**

The information is displayed graphically to show clearly what nutrients the user may be deficient in. Or conversely, whether they are consuming too much of something e.g. cholesterol. 

The user is able to filter the view of a line graph to show their intake of any specific nutrient over time.

The 3 most deficient nutrients are calculated and are used to suggest recipes to the user to address those deficiencies. The user is able to filter these recipes based upon their dietary requirements. For example, if they are vegan.
